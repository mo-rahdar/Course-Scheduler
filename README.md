# Course-scheduler
A Python-based course scheduling tool with optimization and visualization. Supports interactive input and visualization using Jupyter Notebook and VoilÃ .

This project is a **course scheduling and visualization tool** built with Python.  
It uses optimization techniques to assign courses to professors based on their preferences, restrictions, and availability, and produces both **Excel outputs** and **visual teaching schedules**.

The program can be run as a **Jupyter Notebook** or as a **web app** using [VoilÃ ](https://voila.readthedocs.io/), which turns the notebook into an interactive dashboard (no coding required for end users).
